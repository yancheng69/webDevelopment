/* Challenge 2: Complete the init() function so that you build HTML output as per the wireframe diagram image.
Notes:
1) Images
   a. Titles and Pizza are both images stored in the images folder.
   b. When creating the images give each a class of either "title" or "pizza" respectively
   c. Each image has been conveniently labeled with a number at the end in order to use a 
      loop to retrieve the images.
2) Create an appropriate random price to display for each pizza
3) Enter quantity is a text input
4) Buy is a button input

Now that you have the template, use a for loop to produce all five pizza cards.
